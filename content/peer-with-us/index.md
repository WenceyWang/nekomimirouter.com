# Peer with us!

We run mesh networks over multiple endpoints including datacenters, our houses, and school labs. These networks are non-profit, for educational and amateur scientific research purposes.

If you also run non-profit networks, you may peer with us. We run [DN42](https://dn42.eu/) with IPv4/IPv6 and Internet with IPv6. We use BGP for inter-AS routing, [Babel](https://www.irif.fr/~jch/software/babel/) and BGP for intra-AS routing.

To reach us, click on the e-mail button on the top-right corner of this page.

Note: we **DO NOT** provide public commercial service, and our services have **no SLA**. We reserve the rights to accept or reject any requests based on our preference.

## Bedroom colocation service

Alternatively, you may colocate a router, a server, a Raspberry Pi, or other devices on colocation racks located in our bedrooms, if they are small, quiet, and cool.

Since we constantly move home, please consult us for locations available.

(We reserve the rights to check, disassemble, or even reject your devices for safety reasons, usually for DIY devices.)
